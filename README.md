About the Project

Are you someone interested in learning a new game but there's no real explainations? Are  you just struggling to figure out 
how to learn a certain aspect of a new game? Or are you just someone looking to checkout and make sure you're doing things
right in a game. No matter who you are, you'll find Noob Gaming to be a great place to learn the basics of many different games!

Coming from a long standing background and interest in gaming, I've developed a love for harder and more serious games over the 
years. However, a big part of the difficulty of these games is their learn by doing mentality, which can be very daunting in the
face of gamers and can push people away from a game very quickly. This has lead me to create Noob Gaming, a site for gamers new
and old who feel up to the task of learning a new game.
